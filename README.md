# Django Test Driven Development Tutorial

Project which works through the book "Obey the Testing Goat" - abandoned after about 6 chapters. 

## Motivation

The tutorial I was working through claimed to teach TDD (test-driven development) as well as Django by having me create a Django website. My issue with this tutorial is that it told me exactly what to do and where to save things and how to type things. I did these things, but had no actual understanding of what I was doing or why. When I came back and tried to explain it to myself, or tried to use that knowledge to start a different project in Django, I felt lost. 

I think that (a) This set-of-instructions style of tutorial is fairly useless and (b) that understanding how Django works without first having a more basic understanding of how to create a website from scratch is very difficult. 

This project was abandoned in favor of learning more about building a web application from the ground up.
